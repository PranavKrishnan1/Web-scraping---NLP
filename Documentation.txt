The reviews for manageengine from capterra were scraped using R. Each review was tokenized and commonly used words like 
"the" or "and" were removed. The frequency of each word was then found and a dataframe was created.

A bar plot was then generated, plotting each word against its frequency. A word cloud was also generated.
Further NLP can be done on this dataset.
