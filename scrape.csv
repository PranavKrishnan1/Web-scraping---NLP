"1","“Exactly as they advertise. Big 4's are a pain.”Overall: We used ServiceDesk in the ISP (Internet Service Provider) that I worked for. We nearly lost hope in finding good helpdesk software with ITIL compliance. We even considered building a home-made application. For two years, BMC Remedy gave us a hard time from a usability and performance perspective, in addition to their highly priced customization bills. Until, one day, a decent consultant forwarded a link to ServiceDesk Plus.

ServiceDesk Plus breaks the myth that 'java server applications are slow' and really shows that a high quality product with good efficiency and performance can be built using Java. It's all up to the engineers (and when it's slow, its all their fault).

One thing I learned from ServiceDesk; don't blindly trust Gartner reports when searching for good software. At the time of searching, Gartner Quarterly reports listed BMC at the top with no mention whatsoever of ServiceDesk Plus. I'm not blaming Gartner for corrupt information, I'm sure they have their criteria in place, but at the end, they're humans, they have their mistakes, biases, misinformation, etc.
Pros: 1. Light-weight and highly responsive. Intuitive interface.
2. Wonderful 'Solutions Knowledge Base' side feature based on articles and with an excellent search functionality. (We no longer use Media Wiki, however I'm doubtful about dropping MediaWiki).
3. The ServiceDesk API gives you unlimited abilities to automate and integrate with other applications. For example, we were able to integrate Nagios Network Monitoring tool so that a high priority alarm could automatically open a ticket on ServiceDesk Plus.

4. I admire the effort they placed on their online documention with their and searchable online you'll hardly need to contact support.
Cons: Nothing major, but would like to see improvements in the following areas:
1. Provide a visual view of all entities in the system. Virtual Machines, Routers, Physical Servers, etc. using graphing tools.
2. Provide a searchable menu. For example, if I type ""LDAP Authentication"" this would show me the ""Domain Controllers"" in the setup menu (Similar to CPanel's menu search feature).
3. More help notes & tips on 'what to do next' and on 'keyboard shortcuts'.

"2","“Great ticketing system for helpdesk ”Overall: This is a great helpdesk application for most small-to-medium companies who don't need all the extra features that come with Autodesk, connectwise or Salesforce.  Worked directly out of the box with minimal configurations needed.Pros: Ease of use, setup, low resource consumption on server, built-in reporting is enough for my company, Solutions, preventative maintenance tasks, templates, email fetching, user portal, external mobile app.Cons: Reporting isn't that user friendly, upgrades don't allow skipping of versions, not cumulative. Support isn't that good in resolving issues, so luckily we haven't had many"
"3","“Easy implementation with highly intuitive configuration set up”Overall: Good overall experience with purchase and implementation of the product. Easy to configure and use for both technicians and users.Pros: Implementation and configuring was easy. Integration to AD to create user profiles. Intuitiveness of features for both the user community and technicians made it easy for all to use the product. Wholistic list of functionalities and features.Cons: Apart from minimal verbiage changes that was not allowed in the application, so far most of the things are positive looking. You can submit a feature request for modification to the application."
"4","“ServiceDesk Plus Works and a great price”Overall: They are ol' reliable and they get the job done.  I'm happy to continue to use them.Pros: It works great for our help desk needs.  There are plenty of other features that we still need to explore such as creating multiple groups to add in departments.Cons: Some of the features can be a little better such as the contracts section.  That being said I haven't found a great contracts section for any of the products I have used."
"5","“Basic Helpdesk Application”Overall: Our company has been using ManageEngine plus ServiceDesk for our IT Helpdesk support system for several years now.  Although this application has been reliable and used widely by our IT support team, it is limited on features and functionality.  The support for the application from ManageEngine has been somewhat limited as well.   If you are looking for a very basic IT support system, then ManageEngine's ServiceDesk might be a good fit.  The application is just limited on what it can do and its ability to scale to fit our needs.Pros: ServiceDesk Plus from ManageEngine is fairly easy to implement and provides the most basic needs of an IT support application.Cons: ServiceDesk Plus from ManageEngine is very limited in features and functionality.  It also has a fairly complex interface that is out of date.  Our company has trouble tracking IT support tickets because of this limitation.Recommendations to other buyers: If you need a very basic IT support system, then ServiceDesk Plus from ManageEngine might be a good fit.  However, evaluate all of the features (or lack thereof) and your long-term objective before deciding on this product.  This application has not changed or been updated in several years."
